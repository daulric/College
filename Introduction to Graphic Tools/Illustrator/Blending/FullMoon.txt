Full Moon
written by: Praveen

watching the full moon
shining brightly up in the dark sky
i can’t resist drawing a parallel to my life;

one complete circle it has come,
what started as a small thing
has now been completed and finished
with the next stage already in motion;

just like a full moon,
my life achieved its highest peak and
like all good things, it has come to an end,
and slowly fades away into oblivion;

bit by bit, it starts fading away
bit by bit, slowly and steadily
leaving a long lasting impression behind
it is slowly moved out of context;

life goes on,
up and down,
waning and waxing
like a moon;

just like the craters on the moon,
all events etched deep into our memories
never fading away and reminding us of the
good and the bad days of life;
